# EnginePlus Intruduction

>  **EnginePlus** is a big data cluster management service that helps users to manage and operate clusters such as Hadoop.

## Features
 * `One-click` create cluster.(Hadoop)
 * `Healthy-Status` dection in cluster.
 * `Auto-Scaling` for cluster nodes.
 
  Of course, it is not only that, we have done in-depth optimization for cluster performance and other related parameters,
the performance compared with similar instances is better than **AWS EMR** and **Aliyun EMR** .

With some simple operations, users can start a service to maintain a high performance cluster.

## Quick-Start Guide 
Assumption: You are familiar with AWS.
Prepare: 
 - `SSH key` user is ec2-user
 - `IAM role`: `ssm:*`, `aws-marketplace:*`.
 - Security Group Ids:one for EnginePlus instance, another for cluster instances.
 - VPC subnetId
 - MySQL RDS(Optional)
 
You can generate those in AWS.

> Steps :  
> **AWS CloudFormation** --> **Start Service** --> **Create cluster** --> **Run Application**

### Step 1: 
Subscribe EnginePlus.
### Step 2:
Use AWS CloudFormation to deploy the service automatically (The AMI will be provided by subscription in AWS Marketplace).
Please fill out the CloudFormation as blows,all of fields is required:

When the instance is launched,we can access it via:  `https://{host}` , port is `443`.
We recommend that you open the external network access port of 443, or access it through proxy.

As shown above, the EnginePlus server manages all host resources in cluster units.
1. For EnginePlus, the examples are mainly divided into two categories, `server instance` and `cluster instance`.
2. All instances use the same ssh key for authentication.
3. Server and cluster are recommended to use different security group configurations. Because you need to access github and all machines of cluster, you need to open all outbound rules.
4. The port of 22, 443 related inbound access should be allowed in server security group.
5. Because the cluster needs to access all instance communication, for security reasons, all ports must be opened to the internal network.
6. Cluster and the server instance use the same IAM role. You need to enable  `ssm:*`,` aws-marketplace:*` for this IAM role.
Actually,we only need permissions of ssm as belows:
```
        "ssm:SendCommand",
        "ssm:ListCommands",
        "ssm:ListDocumentVersions",

        "ssm:DescribeDocumentParameters",
        "ssm:ListAssociations",
        "ssm:DescribeAvailablePatches"
```

7. Since the meta-information of cluster needs to be managed, it is recommended that users should provide a third-party mysql database to maintain these meta-information. You only need to provide the database address, username, and password here. The user must have the permissions of creating `database`, `table`, `index`, etc. 
    We also maintain an open source mysql called MariaDB internally, when you don't need RDS to manage meta-info, you can use metaHost=`localhost` , metaUserName=`root`, metaPassword=`root` directly (required). 
8. Temporarily only supports us-east-1, when you select subnetId, we should take the security group into consideration.

### Step 3:
When EnginePlus is deployed successfully, you can access `https://{host}` to sigin in to the management page. Users can choose `Install Cluster` to install new cluster.

- When click `Install Cluster`, you need to fill out the installation form:

![](https://github.com/engine-plus/document/blob/master/jpg/d87e8473068e10c836cc912e411353a0.png?raw=true)

Field | Description
 --- | ---
 Cluster Name | EnginePlus will create a  database named by`{ClusterName}`, store the cluster meta.
 @User/@Password | login username/password credentials used by Cluster management based on 'ambari' 
 SubnetId | the cluster vpc subnetId 
 Company | Cloud Provider, only support aws currently
 Instance | Instance type

- After the user submits, the installation progress can be observed on the left side. Once the installation is completed, the cluster will be displayed in the middle form. The installation takes about 20 minutes.

**Users can install multiple clusters, but must wait for the previous installation before submitting the installation.**

- Once the installation is successful, we can check the details through the `Detail` button.

#### Resource Scaling
When the cluster is installed, there is only one NodeManager in Hadoop Cluster. We can set our resource requirements manually or auto-scaling rules according to  requirements.

##### Manual Operation

##### Auto-scaling Strategy

### Step 4: Run test Application
When the installation is successful, we can click on the access to `ambari` in the upper right corner. We use Ambari to complete the job of cluster management and installation.

After the installation is completed, the components are:

![UTOOLS1566287275715.png](https://github.com/engine-plus/document/blob/master/jpg/828db6e9982c689a56079df19596771a.png?raw=true)

Now, We can submit the application on the `ambari server` instance:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

INPUT_PATH="s3a://mob-emr-test/dongtao/data/"
OUTPUT_PATH="s3a://mob-emr-test/dongtao/output/MapReduce"

hadoop fs -rm -r "${OUTPUT_PATH}"

hadoop jar \
       hadoop-study-1.0-selfcontained.jar \
       job.HadoopSaligia \
       ${INPUT_PATH} \
       ${OUTPUT_PATH}
```
Of course, the cluster environment files are all located in the '/usr/HDP/' directory, where users can download and put into their own instance's environment if they want to submit their applications in other instances.
### Remove Cluster
> **Note**:
1. For security reasons, the operation of remove cluster only deletes the part of the monitor mounting, and the instance and the meta-information database are still in use. You need to manually release the instances and delete the database corresponding to mysql, if you want to remove completely.
2. If the installation is failed, you need to check whether the database has been added. 
If the database has been automatically added, you need to manually delete it to prevent 
the subsequent installation process.
